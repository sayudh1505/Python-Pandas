# Pandas Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Pandas Learning Repository**! This repository documents my comprehensive journey of mastering Pandas, a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. Below is the list of topics I have covered during this learning process.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

1. **Introduction to Pandas**  
   * Understanding the basics of Pandas, its importance, and key features.  

2. **Creating DataFrames**  
   * Techniques for creating DataFrames using dictionaries, lists, and external files.  

3. **Exploring Data**  
   * Inspecting data using `head()`, `tail()`, `info()`, and `describe()`.  

4. **Dealing with Duplicate Values**  
   * Methods to detect and handle duplicate rows using `drop_duplicates()`.  

5. **Handling Missing Data**  
   * Managing missing values with `fillna()`, `dropna()`, and interpolation techniques.  

6. **Column Transformation**  
   * Renaming, modifying columns, and applying functions, including advanced transformations using `apply()` and vectorized operations.  

7. **GroupBy in Pandas**  
   * Aggregating data using `groupby()` for summaries and insights.  

8. **Merge, Concatenate, and Join**  
   * Combining DataFrames with `merge()`, `concat()`, and `join()`.  

9. **Comparing DataFrames**  
   * Identifying differences between DataFrames using methods like `equals()` and `compare()`.  

10. **Pivoting and Melting DataFrames**  
    * Reshaping data with `pivot()`, `pivot_table()`, and `melt()`.
